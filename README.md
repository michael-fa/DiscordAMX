Please read the [Wiki page](https://github.com/michael-fa/DiscordAMX/wiki) for all information.
This requires some knowledge about the [PAWN](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm) language.


## Todo
<br>
--------------

* Test internal user join and leave logic (keeping track of users to make scripting with user ids and guild ids)
* Forum Support
* Music (MP3, YOUTBE) support for voice chat
* Rewrite command systems, use the command system that DSharp+ is actually having.
	* Example would be RegisterCommand(context_callback[], role??, help_text??) , called to register command.
	* The callback would then be called when the internal DS+ command execution happends, passing above stuff to script?

Better readme soon.
